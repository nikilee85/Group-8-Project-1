# Group-8-Project-1

## Project Proposal

The scope and purpose of this project is to analyse government spending on jobless people from 2015 to 2017.

## Jobactive

Jobactive is an Australian Government-funded network of organisations (private and community, and originally also government) that are contracted by the Australian Government, through the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE), to deliver employment services to unemployed job seekers on Government income support payments and employers. This is to help applicants acquire a job and become independent.

Providers were initially selected for the network and allocated business through a competitive public tender process, with contract periods running for varying lengths of time determined by the Australian Government. There were over 1,000 sites across Australia delivering Job Services Australia. These sites were overseen by DEEWR.

To be eligible for support, people need to be in receipt of eligible income support payments, such as Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance, the Disability Support Pension or Parenting Payment.

## Data Source

Jobactive Employment Fund dataset can be found in the following location.
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariosliew92/jobactive-employment-fund?resource=download>

The dataset contains the applications of getting employment funds to cover the applicants' costs related to job searching, job training, relocation assistance, medical and mental expenses et cetera that can help the applicants to acquire a job and become independent. Therefore, it consists of the demographic details, such as education level, age, race, and Jobactive Stream of the applicants, and the reason for getting the employment fund.

There are 3 main streams in Jobactive inlcuding a 4th stream that is a volunteer one.

* Stream A: (highly trained applicants that require minimum support)
* Stream B: (mediumly trained applicants that require additional support for them to be job ready)
* Stream C: (applicants that require support to gain vocational or professional skills to be job ready).
