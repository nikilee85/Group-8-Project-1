Jobactive is an Australian Government-funded network of organisations (private and community, and originally also government) that are contracted by the Australian Government, through the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE), to deliver employment services to unemployed job seekers on Government income support payments and employers.

Providers were initially selected for the network and allocated business through a competitive public tender process, with contract periods running for varying lengths of time determined by the Australian Government. There were over 1,000 sites across Australia delivering Job Services Australia. These sites were overseen by DEEWR.

To be eligible for support, people need to be in receipt of eligible income support payments, such as Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance, the Disability Support Pension or Parenting Payment.

The dataset contains the applications of getting employment funds to cover the applicants' costs related to job searching, job training, relocation assistance, medical and mental expenses et cetera that can help the applicants to acquire a job and become independent. Therefore, it consists of the demographic details, such as education level, age, race, and Jobactive Stream of the applicants, and the reason for getting the employment fund.

There are 3 streams in Jobactive:

Stream: A (highly trained applicants that require minimum support)
B (mediumly trained applicants that require additional support for them to be job ready)
C (applicants that require support to gain vocational or professional skills to be job ready).

Help applicants acquire a job and become independent.
“Our project is to generate a report that breaks down the government spending on Indigenous, homeless people who has a history of previous offence through the Job active employment fund in 2017. We will examine the funding based on gender, age group and previous education. We will generate reports based on the categories the funding was allocated for and the corresponding streams they are categorised”.
