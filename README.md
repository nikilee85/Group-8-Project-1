# Group-8-Project-1

## Project Proposal

The scope and purpose of this project is to analyse government spending on jobless people from 2015 to 2017.

## Jobactive

Jobactive is an Australian Government-funded network of organisations (private and community, and originally also government) that are contracted by the Australian Government, through the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE), to deliver employment services to unemployed job seekers on Government income support payments and employers. This is to help applicants acquire a job and become independent.

Providers were initially selected for the network and allocated business through a competitive public tender process, with contract periods running for varying lengths of time determined by the Australian Government. There were over 1,000 sites across Australia delivering Job Services Australia. These sites were overseen by DEEWR.

To be eligible for support, people need to be in receipt of eligible income support payments, such as Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance, the Disability Support Pension or Parenting Payment.

## Data Source

Jobactive Employment Fund dataset can be found in the following location.
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariosliew92/jobactive-employment-fund?resource=download>

The dataset contains the applications of getting employment funds to cover the applicants' costs related to job searching, job training, relocation assistance, medical and mental expenses et cetera that can help the applicants to acquire a job and become independent. Therefore, it consists of the demographic details, such as education level, age, race, and Jobactive Stream of the applicants, and the reason for getting the employment fund.

There are 3 main streams in Jobactive inlcuding a 4th stream which is a volunteer stream.

* Stream A: (highly trained applicants that require minimum support)
* Stream B: (mediumly trained applicants that require additional support for them to be job ready)
* Stream C: (applicants that require support to gain vocational or professional skills to be job ready).

## Project Title

â€œOur project is to generate a report that breaks down the government spending on unemployed Jobseekers, and explore some of the factors that may potentially influence the unemployment and employment of Jobseekers who are a part of the Jobactive Employment Fund program".

 Analyse the data to find government spending for jobkeepers for indigenous people over a period of 3 years from 2015 to 2017. This analysis will include examining the spending on homeless people and people who have a history of previous offence. Analysis based on gender, categories the funding was allocated for and the streams will be considered. Analysis will be done on spending by each states as well.

Questions that will be answered:

* How many Indigenous jobseekers were funded from 2015 to 2017?
* What was the gender distribution of Indigenous Jobseekers? Was it a huge difference?
* What was the total amount spent and percentage spent by cateogry? What were the top 3 categories?
* What was the total amount spent and percentage spent by streams?
* What was the total number and percentage of indigenous jobseekers who were homeless and/or ex-offenders? How much does homelessness and ex-offence contribute to joblessness
* What was the number of indigenous bobseekers by State from 2015 to 2017?
* What was the total and average funding by state from 2015 to 2017?

Questions that will be answered:

- Does the education level of the jobseekers have any relation to unemployment/employment? (Higher education level vs Lower)
- How many of the jobseekers in this data have a higher level of education (Bachelor, diploma, etc) compared to those with a lower level of education (Year10/11, 12/13, etc)?  
- Does education level have a relation to unemployment length?
- Which age group has the most amount of Jobseekers?
- If there are a significant amount of jobseekers in a given age group, why is this the case? Is it because of their education level?

**Steve**
    Questions that will be answered:
    *The level of spending for each education level.
    * Do less educated jobseekers get more or less spending, than secondary or tertiary educated jobseekers
    * Compare each age cohort seeking job active, to population cohort from census
